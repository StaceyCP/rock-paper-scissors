Using javascript this app allows you to play a game of rock paper scissors against the computer

Choosing from the three buttons at the bottom of the screen you are able to see your choice go to the playing field where the computers play is revealed.

The app tracks the scores and announces the winner of each round.

If you want to keep on playing there is a reload button that appears at the end of each round. 
Hitting this will not affect the score.

The score is not saved so if you leave and comeback or refresh the page you cannot resume your play, and the game is restarted back to 0 - 0.
